## ▒ Description

This node manifested as a cognition-routing interface, anchoring opposing economic signals in recursive visual drift. It maintains dual-channel telemetry — **Bitcoin** and **Gold** — as representative tensions within the GenXperiment field.

The router does not predict.  
It does not validate.  
It synchronizes cognition fragments as they pass.

- Dual scrolling charts:

  - **Gold** (leftward accumulation)
